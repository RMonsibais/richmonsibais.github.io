    <p>Hi! my name is Richard Monsibais, I am from Southern California, happily married, we have two pit bulls and I am currently driving a truck locally delivering flowers for a major retailer. I have always wanted to work with computers and now I am finally
        taking that step forward. Feels great! Follow along with me as I grow to become the best developer I can be!!
